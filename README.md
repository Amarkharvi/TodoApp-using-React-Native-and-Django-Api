# TodoApp-using-React-Native-and-Django-Api
<h3>Frontend react native and Backend Django framework api</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frontend is built using reactnative , both for ios and android </li>
<li> Django is used as backend and created a todo model </li>
<li> using djangorestframework  we created a api for the todo app</li>
<li> Then the react native app fetches the json data present in the api and displayed in the list view</li>
</ul>

Thank you
